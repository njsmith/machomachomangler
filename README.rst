    It's Saturday afternoon, I've got the flu, and I'm spending my
    free time writing software to make a proprietary operating system
    -- backed by one of the world's larger corporations -- more usable
    for developers. Because Microsoft can't be bothered to pay for
    such things, and is dependent on charity.

    To assuage my annoyance, this software is licensed under the *GNU
    Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software
    Foundation, either version 3 of the License or (at your option)
    any later version*.

    This shouldn't have any effect on most uses, since it only affects
    people who are redistributing the software or running it on behalf
    of other people; you can *use* this software to manipulate
    BSD-licensed DLLs, proprietary-licensed DLLs, or whatever you
    like, and that's fine.

    However, if for some reason you or your company have an irrational
    allergy to this license, send me `an email
    <mailto:njs@pobox.com>`_ and we'll work out an appropriate tithe.
